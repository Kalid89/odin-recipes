            STEPS
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Brown Ground Beef : In a skillet pan, over medium-high heat, brown and crumble the ground beef with the onion, garlic, and salt. Once beef is no longer pink be sure and drain the excess grease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spaghetti Sauce : Add the remaining ingredients including tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, sugar, basil, oregano, and salt & pepper. Stir to combine. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simmer : This is the most important step! Bring the spaghetti sauce to a low boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and let it simmer for at least 25 minutes. Longer if you can! The flavor gets better and better the longer it simmers. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve : Serve the meat sauce over pasta noodles of choice.
